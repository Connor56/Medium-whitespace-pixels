# Medium Whitespace Pixels
Contains transparent pixel images that allow you to add whitespace to your content on Medium. All the images are completely free to use.

# Purpose
If you write dense tutorial content on Medium the article can start to feel cramped and busy. In these situations, it would be ideal to use whitespace to avoid cognitive overload. However, this is not an option Medium provides by default.

To get around this, you can use transparent images that are 1 pixel wide to force Medium to give you the spacing you want.

This repository contains spacers for pixel heights of `{1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100}`.

I hope you find them useful for formatting your article!
